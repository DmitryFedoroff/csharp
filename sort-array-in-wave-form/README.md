# Sort array in wave form

## Description:

Write a program to sort an array of integers in such a way that the numbers in the array are arranged in a wave form.

## Note:

An array is in wave form when array[0] >= array[1] <= array[2] >= array[3] <= array[4] >= ... and if we will form a graph it will be in an up-down fashion rather than a straight line.

## Example:

```
Input: [6, 8, 3, 1, 1, 7, 0, 4, 3, 0]
Output: [8, 3, 6, 1, 7, 0, 4, 1, 3, 0]
```
