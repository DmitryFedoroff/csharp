# Fibonacci sequence without recursion

## Description:

Print first n Fibonacci numbers without using recursion method. The first two numbers of Fibonacci series are 0 and 1.

## Note:

Recursive solution may involve heavy use of the limited resources of the computer because they involve a potentially large number of function calls. True iterative solution is always better than recursive one and implemented using a looping construct.

## Example:

```
Input: 5
Output: 0 1 1 2 3
```
```
Input: 3
Output: 0 1 1
```
```
Input: 7
Output: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8
```
